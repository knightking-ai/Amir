The _'Imaging'_ feature covers image lifecycle management. That is, to generate new images and update any given host-pool session host with the new image. This component leverages several Azure services and capabilities discussed below.

You can also specify where you would like your images hosted, in the Azure Shared Image Gallery, as a managed image or a VHD.|
| ![imageTemplate.png](/.attachments/imageTemplate-dbba4726-ab90-4c20-98d0-32a59d452096.png =15x) | Image Template | WVD-Imaging-RG | A standard Azure Image Builder template that defines the parameters for building a custom image with AIB. The parameters include image source (Marketplace, custom image, etc), customization options (i.e., Updates, scripts, restarts), and distribution (i.e., managed image, shared image gallery). |
| ![Managed Identities.svg](/.attachments/Managed%20Identities-b1ca08e0-279d-4e2e-883f-fda2f760827d.svg =15x) | User-Assigned Managed Identity | WVD-Imaging-RG | Azure Active Directory feature that eliminates the need for credentials in code, rotates credentials automatically, and reduces identity maintenance. In the context of the imaging solution, the MSI is used by the Image Builder Service as well the pipeline to trigger the image template creation. |
| ![Shared Image Galleries.svg](/.attachments/Shared%20Image%20Galleries-d4c4db2d-8bc5-42f4-b246-8a27b2723114.svg =15x) | Shared Image Gallery | WVD-Imaging-RG | Azure service that helps to build structure and organization for managed images.
