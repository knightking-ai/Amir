This section provides an overview of the requirements to be met before deploying the WVD environment.

There are three different types of prerequisites that have to be in place, before the WVD host pool(s) can be deployed:

| Step | Description  | Responsibility |
|--|--|--|
| **1. Prerequisites** | We need several resources/services to be set up in the customer environment prior to the engagement| **Customer**: these steps have to be performed by the customer, before the WVD offer's delivery starts. We only validate that these prerequisites are in place.|
| **2. DevOps Enablement** | We need to set up a number of components to enable Azure DevOps deployments | **Shared**: Azure DevOps project has to be prepared by the customer; MCS supports code onboarding and related steps.  |
| **3. WVD Service Enablement** | And finally a Global Administrator is needed to onboard the WVD service | **Shared**: these steps can only be run on behalf of a user that holds the Global Administrator role in AAD, therefore these steps will be performed together with the customer. |
